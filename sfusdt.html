				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>
					Client: SFU Satellite Design Team<br>
					Role: Designer<br>
					When: December 2016<br>
					Tools: Adobe Illustrator
				</p>
				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					The SFU Satellite Design Team wanted to integrate nationality and aerospace into one design, hoping to emulate other aerospace logos often used as patches.
				</p>
				<h4>Challenges</h4>
				<p>
					An initial challenge of the project was the subject matter of the club as I did not have any knowledge of aerospace. Attending their group meetings and asking for layman explanations was critical in me contextualizing their values to be integrated into a logo reflective of aerospace.
				</p>

					<figcaption class="caption">
						The maple leaf was decided to be the container for the rest of the elements (and later the horizon as a base) since it was the largest; different variations were drawn (the second biggest element, a satellite, was included as a reference).
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Concerning the design itself, the primary challenge was to integrate predetermined aspects of the logo chosen by the club such as the font and elements used. One might think this might have made it easier to create the logo but combining all four elements (maple leaf, orbit, satellite, and stars) in an aesthetically pleasing way had to be kept in mind as well as the response of the client.

				<h4>Insights</h4>
				<p>
					My main take away from this project was to involve one's self with the client and attend their meetings as it will contextualize abstract concepts leading to an effective design. Another take away was settling with simplicity and relaying that to the client; the logo is simple and monochromatic. While it was a hard decision to make, it ultimately ended up being the superior choice as it matched the aesthetic the client was going for.
