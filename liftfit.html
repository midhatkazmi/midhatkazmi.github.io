						Background
					</h2>

					<p class="text">
						In a group project for a university course, we were to create a smartphone application that would be developed with a persona in context of any area we chose to focus on.

						Process
					</h2>

					<h3 class="title">
						Topic
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						At first, our group wanted to focus on an app that would track and motivate users to be productive with their diet and exercise. After doing research, we found that both these topics were complex to handle within their own apps, so we decided to focus on exercise as we wanted to create an app for a more apparent and commonly agreed upon action that may not have many variations (unlike food).
					</p>

					<h3 class="title">
						Persona
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						We generated different personas with different needs that would need to be served with the app, and eventually settled on the persona of a young person who has access to weight lifting equipment and wants to start or already goes to the gym. If they want to start going to the gym they may not have any experience and would be too conscious to ask for help. Whatever their weight goals are (to maintain, gain, or lose weight), they want to weightlift to achieve that goal, and eventually gain confidence in going to the gym (for first time goers).
					</p>

					<h3 class="title">
						The Problem
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						Frustrations this persona has (for the inexperienced gym goer) is that they have no gym experience and are too self-conscious to ask for help with weightlifting. For experienced gym goers, their frustration is that there are too many apps online that either are built for one specific workout or functionally or visually unsatisfying to use, as well as not having multiple components from different apps together (e.g. having to search up images of how to do an exercise or having to write down workout notes in a separate app).
					</p>

					<h3 class="title">
						Goals
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						We want users to reach their goals in a safe manner by providing them with instructions about how to do different exercises without having to ask anyone and allow users to be able to create a personalized and customizable workout experience for themselves.

						Features
					</h2>

					<h3 class="title">
						Creating an Account
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						The app can be used with or without an account, either storing data on the cloud or locally in the phone (respectively). Data includes user information and exercise history in order to calculate how much the user would increase the difficulty of their exercises by.

						Creating a Workout
					</h3>

This can be bypassed by using the quick add feature which automatically applies the default sets and reps you chose when you created the workout; you are given one more chance to edit that amount for this instance. Exercise weight is either the default or most recently used value.

						Workout Mode

						Cooldown Mode
					</h3>

						When the user is done with their set, they can continue to cooldown mode. The timer automatically starts, and dynamically changes depending on whether you were able to complete a set (if failed, it gives you more time). Overtime is indicated by a tick (and can add up) to let the user know how much they are going overtime by.
					</p>

					<p class="text">
						Users can pause, reset, or add overtime rest. These values are determined from the default workout values, but can be edited during cooldown.

						Challenges
					</h2>

					<p class="text">
						The main challenge of this project was narrowing down enough on all aspects to be able to create an app that is able to address everything. This was a simultaneous process where the topic and the persona influenced each other. Because even when separated from diet, exercise is such a complex topic due to the variety of activities, we decided to focus on weight lifting exercises, and fulfilling the needs of a persona who prefers to weightlift.
					</p>

			<div class="content">
				<div class="col-4of6 auto-margin">
					<h2 class="subheading">
						Insights
					</h2>

					<p class="text">
						I learned the vital role user research and user experience plays in the creation of user interfaces and user interactions. The creation of features was based on the persona created, and tested with similar users, shaping the final form of the app.

						Future Considerations
					</h2>

					<h3 class="title">
						Onboarding
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						A future consideration to improve this app would be onboarding in the form of demonstrating creating a workout, adding exercises to it, and going through workout and cooldown mode so as to ease the user into exercising language and culture.
					</p>

					<h3 class="title">
						Individual Exercise Card
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						Allow individual exercise cards for warm up/cooldowns before and after workout sessions. Individual exercise cards would work in the same way workout cards do and require:
					</p>

					<div class="wrap-container">
						<div class="col-3of6">

						Automatically Generating a Workout
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						A useful feature for an existing workout without manually inputting everything would be to input a list of exercises with sets, reps and weights, where the app would generate a workout by parsing the text, and allowing the user to review it before adding it as a workout.
					</p>

					<h3 class="title">
						Notification / Smartwatch Integration
					</h3>

					<p class="text">
						To go along with the minimization in-app, prototype a currently running workout notification that can be interacted with on the lockscreen or status bar.
					</p>

					<p class="text">
						Smartwatch integration can be implemented with a similar minimized and interactive prototype.
