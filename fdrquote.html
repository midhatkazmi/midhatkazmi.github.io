				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>
					Course: <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2016/spring/iat/102/d100" target="_blank">Graphic Design</a><br>
					When: April 2016<br>
					Group: Natasha Wainwright and Sheri Wong<br>
					Role: Designer<br>
					Tools: Adobe Illustrator &middot; Photoshop
				</p>
				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					The third and final project in my one of my first post-secondary classes, our group was assigned a precedent for a designer from a specific era with a particular style: Jan Tschichold, who did Swiss design. We were to emulate his style through the format of a poster containing a quote along with the name and image of the quoted person; the product would be viewed off-screen (poster) and on-screen (mobile).
				</p>
				<h4>Challenges</h4>

				<p>
					Since I had went through two other projects concerning design, the challenge in this project concerned the group. We were assigned to make designs divergent from each other, but when it came time to choose the final look, the converging process was difficult. This was overcome by being able to explain my design decisions not only when viewed in a vacuum, but physically and digitally as well. In the end my design was chosen and our group incorporated strong points and suggestions from their iterations.
				</p>
				<h4>Insights</h4>
				<p>
					In the end, we received an A for our project, and praise from our professor and TA (who liked my design out of the others as well).
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of group dynamics, I learned to and demonstrated listening to others as well as presenting my own arguments coherently when it comes time to converge our divergent processes (iterations); this skill will allow me to fully think through my initial stages of designing (before or during the diverging process) and make a thoughtful design.
