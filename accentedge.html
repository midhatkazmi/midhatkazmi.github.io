							I was a graphic design intern for Accentedge&mdash;a technology management startup. I was tasked with creating the branding for this company which included branding guidelines (for current employees and future graphic design interns to reference), stationary and social media graphics.

								Process
							</h3>
						</div>

						<p class="text">
							I created part of the branding based on an already existing logo (whose font I refreshed). The logo was emphasized throughout the branding through the outside cover of the branding guidelines, stationary and social media graphics by emulating the angles in the logomark.
						</p>

						<h2 class="subheading">
							Branding Guidelines
						</h2>

						<p class="text">
							In the branding guidelines, use of the logo was explained including spacing, placement and visibility of the logo. Colours were sampled from the existing logo, as well as other colours that can and cannot be used with the logo. The font of the logo was refreshed to a similar one and the rest of the typography was sans-serif to evoke a modern feeling. Imagery was to give an impression of progress, success and collaboration via physical activities and athleticism, as well as candid photography. Files were linked to applicable graphics such as logo variations, stationary, social media post templates, etc.

						<h2 class="subheading">
							Stationary
						</h2>

						<p class="text">
							Branding was consistently and visibly emphasized in the stationary which included a letterhead, envelope and business card. Links were provided for these files as well as a Microsoft Word Document of the letterhead, packaged with the company fonts and no graphics at the edges to allow for clean printing.

						<h2 class="subheading">
							Social Media Graphics
						</h2>

						<p class="text">
							Social media post templates were developed to highlight current interns and feature quotes. An electronic advert was created which was displayed in the lobby of the building the company resides (among others), describing itself and where to find them (online). Other graphics included social media headers and hiring graphics.

								Details
							</h3>
						</div>

						<p class="text">
							Something I noticed when I started to create the branding guidelines was that on their social media display pictures, the logo looked off-center even though it was technically centered according to the given space. This is because the peak of the letter 'A' was not in the middle, and the streak on the right took more space than the left and offset it.
						</p>
					</div>

						<figure class="fig">
							<img class="img" src="img/accentedge/logo.jpg">
						</figure>
					</div>

					<div class="grid col-8of12">
						<p class="text">
							Because of this I felt it was important to note in the branding guidelines that the logo should be centered according to peak of the letter 'A', and made sure the logo files the employees had access to were spaced beforehand (with extra spacing on the left) to ensure the result would be the logo's true middle.

								Challenges
							</h3>
						</div>

						<p class="text">
							This was a remote position, so I had to deliver and justify my design decisions over email and phone, and receive feedback in the same form without live visual feedback. Because of the extra time this can take versus in-person, I made sure to justify my work with evidence and communicate clearly with my supervisor, resulting in quick turnaround of graphics.

								Insights
							</h3>
						</div>

						<p class="text">
							This internship allowed me to create a brand from scratch and see what makes up a brand, as well as create a reference for future graphic design interns to follow and other employees to use (i.e. templates). The remote aspect of this internship allowed me to practice clearly communicating my work and justifying it with evidence over limited communication (phone and email).
