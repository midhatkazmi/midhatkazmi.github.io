				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>
					Course: <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2018/spring/iat/334/d100" target="_blank">Interface Design</a><br>
					When: February 2018<br>
					Group: Sabrina Lee<br>
					Role: Research + Wireframing<br>
					Tools: Adobe Illustrator &middot; Adobe XD
				</p>
				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					In this course, the project was to choose an app to research user problems and come up with a solution feature. This spanned over three weeks, the first consisting of user research, proposing three features in the second week, and choosing and refining one of the previous three features in the final week. Our group chose the Duolingo app and came up with the personal word bank feature.
				</p>
				<p>
					A primary pain point that caused frustration for our persona (created from user research) was that words they were having difficulty with came up infrequently, making them unable to recall the word on a regular basis that would allow them to memorize it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our solution was to allow the user to add words to a personal word bank that they could revisit and be tested exclusively on; the user could also find out details about the word such as the translation, part of speech, and strength of how well the user knows the word. This allowed our persona to not only learn words they have come across, but contextualize themselves to it as well, strengthening their knowledge of the word.
				</p>

				<h4>Challenges</h4>
				<p>
					The main challenge of this project was creating the persona that resulted from our user research. We observed trends in users who were similar and struck a balance between keeping and discarding certain information. The result was a specific persona that the solution feature was based off of and applicable to.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another challenge was consolidating our feature into one distinct feature. This was done by observing the primary function of the feature (to access personally chosen words) and adding controls that would be necessary to use this function.
				</p>
				<h4>Insights</h4>
				<p>
					I learned the vital role user research and user experience plays in the creation of user interfaces and user interactions. The creation of the feature was based off the persona created, another part of the project that leads the creation of concepts in a realistic direction. Researching previously existing apps as well as testing users with the chosen app was an important direction that lead to the outcome of the feature, and not the other way around; it was also helpful to be held to the design standards of an existing brand, allowing more focus on the concept.
